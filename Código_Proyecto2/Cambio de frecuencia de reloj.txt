//clock_prescale_set() function. This function allows you to divide the clock frequency by a prescaler value, which can be set to 1024, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, or 1.

//Here's an example code snippet that sets the clock frequency to 32kHz:
#include <avr/power.h>
void setup() {
  clock_prescale_set(clock_div_2); // Set clock frequency to 32kHz
}
